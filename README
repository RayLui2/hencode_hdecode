To run my program, you can either run "make hencode", "make hdecode", and 
"make htable" all indiviually, or just try "make all" to compile all of them.
For hencode and hdecode, you must give it an input file (argv[1]), and an 
optional output file(argv[2]), if there is no output file, both executables 
will print to standard output. I have a hufftools.c and .h file that includes
functions that all three hencode, htable, and hdecode can use.
